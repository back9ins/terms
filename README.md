BackNine's Terms of Use
This document governs our relationship with users and others who interact with BackNine. By using or accessing BackNine, you agree to these Terms of Use.

Privacy

Your privacy is very important to us. We designed our Privacy Policy to make important disclosures about how you can use BackNine and how we collect and can use your content and information. We encourage you to read the Privacy Policy, and to use it to help you make informed decisions. 
 
Sharing Your Content and Information

When you delete content, it is deleted in a manner similar to emptying the recycle bin on a computer. However, you understand that removed content may persist in backup copies for a reasonable period of time (but will not be available to others).
When you use an application, the application may ask for your permission to access your content and information as well as content and information that others have shared with you.  We require applications to respect your privacy, and your agreement with that application will control how the application can use, store, and transfer that content and information.
We always appreciate your feedback or other suggestions about BackNine, but you understand that we may use your feedback or suggestions without any obligation to compensate you for them (just as you have no obligation to offer them).
 
Safety

We do our best to keep BackNine safe, but we cannot guarantee it. We need your help to keep BackNine safe, which includes the following commitments by you:
You will not post unauthorized commercial communications (such as spam) on BackNine.
You will not collect users' content or information, or otherwise access BackNine, using automated means (such as harvesting bots, robots, spiders, or scrapers) without our prior permission.
You will not engage in unlawful multi-level marketing, such as a pyramid scheme, on BackNine.
You will not upload viruses or other malicious code.
You will not solicit login information or access an account belonging to someone else.
You will not bully, intimidate, or harass any user.
You will not post content that: is hate speech, threatening, or pornographic; incites violence; or contains nudity or graphic or gratuitous violence.
You will not develop or operate a third-party application containing alcohol-related, dating or other mature content (including advertisements) without appropriate age-based restrictions.
You will not use BackNine to do anything unlawful, misleading, malicious, or discriminatory.
You will not do anything that could disable, overburden, or impair the proper working or appearance of BackNine, such as a denial of service attack or interference with page rendering or other BackNine functionality.
You will not facilitate or encourage any violations of this Statement or our policies.
 
Registration and Account Security

BackNine users provide their real names and information, and we need your help to keep it that way. Here are some commitments you make to us relating to registering and maintaining the security of your account:
You will not provide any false personal information on BackNine, or create an account for anyone other than yourself without permission.
You will not create more than one personal account.
If we disable your account, you will not create another one without our permission.
You will not use BackNine if you are under 18.

You will not transfer your account (including any Page or application you administer) to anyone without first getting our written permission.
If you select a username or similar identifier for your account or Page, we reserve the right to remove or reclaim it if we believe it is appropriate (such as when a trademark owner complains about a username that does not closely relate to a user's actual name).
 
Protecting Other People's Rights

We respect other people's rights, and expect you to do the same.
You will not post content or take any action on BackNine that infringes or violates someone else's rights or otherwise violates the law.

If you repeatedly infringe other people's intellectual property rights, we will disable your account when appropriate.
You will not use our copyrights or Trademarks or any confusingly similar marks, except with our prior written permission.
If you collect information from users, you will: obtain their consent, make it clear you (and not BackNine) are the one collecting their information, and post a privacy policy explaining what information you collect and how you will use it.
You will not post anyone's identification documents or sensitive financial information on BackNine.
 
Mobile and Other Devices

We currently provide our mobile services for free, but please be aware that your carrier's normal rates and fees, such as text messaging and data charges, will still apply.
In the event you change or deactivate your mobile telephone number, you will update your account information on BackNine within 48 hours to ensure that your messages are not sent to the person who acquires your old number.
You provide consent and all rights necessary to enable users to sync (including through an application) their devices with any information that is visible to them on BackNine.

Our goal is to deliver advertising and other commercial or sponsored content that is valuable to our users and advertisers. In order to help us do that, you agree to the following:
You give us permission to use your name, profile picture, content, and information in connection with commercial, sponsored, or related content (such as a brand you like) served or enhanced by us. This means, for example, that you permit a business or other entity to pay us to display your name and/or profile picture with your content or information, without any compensation to you. If you have selected a specific audience for your content or information, we will respect your choice when we use it.
